# Pizza-sales-SQL-project
This dataset contain detailed information about pizza orders, including specifics about the pizza variants, quantities, pricing, dates, times, and categorization details. 
Here, I have used SQL to manipulate the Pizza sales data and to extract some insights in order to improve the performance of sales and total profit of the organisation. 
The total Revenue of the organisation of Pizza sales is $817.9K and total pizza sold 49.57k.
The Average order value of pizza is 38.31 which shows on an average there is around 38 pizzas order to be placed.
There is also an insight about avg pizza per order. It shows that around 2 pizzas of orders are to be placed per order.
Orders hours are also calculated in this data. Here the peak hours in which orders are placed are between 12 pm to 1 pm and 4pm to 7pm at the evening.
In this project the daily trend also calculated and it shows that the maximum order are to be placed on Friday.
